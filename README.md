A simple text-based RPG combat prototype built in Python.
You face off against the Dragon Lord using spells, mana, and turn-based decisions.

This project was created as part of my early game development and programming journey to practice:

- Game loops
- Player/enemy stats
- Input handling
- Conditional logic

How the Game Works

You start with:

HP: 105
Mana: 100

The Dragon Lord has 10,000 HP
Each turn, you can choose an action:

fireball → Costs 15 mana, low damage
icearrow → Costs 10 mana, high damage (dragon is weak to ice)
quit → flee the battle

Some actions require a roll to succeed.
Failing a roll can result in instant death 👀

Future Ideas
Things I plan to improve later:

1. Real random dice rolls (gambling baby)
2. Enemy attacks instead of instant death
3. More spells and abilities
4. Items / healing
5. Multiple enemies
